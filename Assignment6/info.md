    Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. 
    
    Store at least three names of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. 
    
    Write a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the screen.
   
    Now, write a Python script that copies the contents from the files cats.txt and dogs.txt, and writes them to a file animals.txt
