A palindrome is a word, or a phrase, that reads same backward as forwards. Write a Python program to check if a word is a palindrome or not.

For example, your program should return True when checking for words "kayak" and "redder", and False when checking for words "abc" etc.

Hint: You should take user input and store it in a string. Then you should define a loop and iterate over each character in the input string. 
You could define a string variable reverse_string and initialize it to empty string "". 
Then you could concat each character from input string to the start of the reverse string. Finally you could check if the input string and reverse string are same.

Extra credit assignment(extra 50 points):
This part of the assignment isn't required, and you may choose not to do it.

A palindrome can also be a phrase with multiple words. Create a new Python file, and write the code to check if a multiple word sentence is a palindrome.

Note: The phrase "Never Odd or Even" is a palindrome.

Hint: You should remove any spaces, and also ignore upper and lower case.
