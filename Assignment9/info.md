    Define a function calculator (this function does not take any input) that asks user to choose from 4 operations: 
        addition, 
        subtraction, 
        multiplication 
        and division. 
    
    Also. ask the user to input two integers inside the calculator function. 
    
    Now define 4 more functions: 
        add, 
        subtract, 
        multiply, 
        and divide. 
        
    These functions should take two inputs. 
    Perform the respective operations on the two inputs in each of the 4 functions and return the result. 
    
    Inside the calculator function, based on what user chose, call the add, subtract, multiply or divide. 
    
    Pass the two integers that you got from user to these functions, and print the results from the functions.
    
    Define a function vowel_count that takes one string as input, and counts the number of vowels in the string. 
    Return the count. 
    
    Call the vowel_count function outside in the file, and print the count.
